  "briefing": "SCENARIO BRIEFING:\n\n6 arrivals inbound to LEZG with multiple conflicts requiring separation. You must:\n\n1. CONFLICT 1 (0-3min): IBE2341 & RYR84PQ at similar altitudes - separate immediately!\n2. CONFLICT 2 (5-8min): VLG447 & NATO01 converging - manage spacing for HI-TAC approach\n3. CONFLICT 3 (8-12min): EZY8923 may conflict with traffic pattern - vector as needed\n\nMILITARY OPERATIONS:\n- NATO01 & NATO02 require HI-TAC 12R approaches from Ambel/Surco\n- Remember to activate LED107 and LED70 deltas if needed for military operations\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTIONS:\n- Descend IBE2341 to FL100, hold RYR84PQ at FL170 initially\n- Assign ILS 30R to IBE2341, VOR 30R to RYR84PQ and VLG447\n- Assign HI-TAC 12R to NATO01 (full procedure) and NATO02 (straight-in)\n- Vector EZY8923 for spacing with VOR traffic\n- Monitor runway usage - coordinate 30R arrivals with possible 12R military traffic\n\nGOOD LUCK, CONTROLLER!",
